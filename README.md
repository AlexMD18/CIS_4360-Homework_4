## 1.) State what the advantages of Virtual Machines are
There are many advantages to using Virtual Machines instead of physical devices. They are great for testing because they cannot affect the computer where they are hosted so potentially dangerous procedures done on a Virtual machine will not harm the physical computer or its drives. It is also very fast, easy and chaeap to create a virtaul machine compaired to having to do these things to a physical device. In most cases, it is totally free to create a virtual machine using a multiude of operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Linux Mint and more. There are even a few VMs that emulate a Mac with an IOS inspired design. As can be seen below, each Operating System is connected to each application. Using vertual machines can help to seperate machines if something needs to be private from other departments and not reachable by the network.

Virtual Machines are programmable and things such as APIs can control and change them with different calls. They can also be very helpful in Information Technology and Management Information Systems departments for several reasons. I have personally used them to test different programs on Linux Ubuntu, as well as setting up windows environments on Macs to run some applications that only were available on the Windows OS. Lastly, using Virtual Machines can be helpful when using diagnostic tools and doing investigations. Kali Linux is a great example of an operating system that can run on a virtual machine to accomplish these tasks.
