## 1.) State what the advantages of Virtual Machines are
     There are many advantages to using Virtual Machines instead of physical devices. They are great for testing because they cannot affect the computer where they are hosted so potentially dangerous procedures done on a Virtual machine will not harm the physical computer or its drives. It is also very fast, easy and chaeap to create a virtaul machine compaired to having to do these things to a physical device. In most cases, it is totally free to create a virtual machine using a multiude of operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Linux Mint and more. There are even a few VMs that emulate a Mac with an IOS inspired design.
