## 1.) State what the advantages of Virtual Machines are
There are many advantages to using Virtual Machines instead of physical devices. They are great for testing because they cannot affect the computer where they are hosted so potentially dangerous procedures done on a Virtual machine will not harm the physical computer or its drives. It is also very fast, easy and chaeap to create a virtaul machine compaired to having to do these things to a physical device. In most cases, it is totally free to create a virtual machine using a multiude of operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Linux Mint and more. There are even a few VMs that emulate a Mac with an IOS inspired design. As can be seen below, each Operating System is connected to each application. Using vertual machines can help to seperate machines if something needs to be private from other departments and not reachable by the network.

Virtual Machines are programmable and things such as APIs can control and change them with different calls. They can also be very helpful in Information Technology and Management Information Systems departments for several reasons. I have personally used them to test different programs on Linux Ubuntu, as well as setting up windows environments on Macs to run some applications that only were available on the Windows OS. Lastly, using Virtual Machines can be helpful when using diagnostic tools and doing investigations. Kali Linux is a great example of an operating system that can run on a virtual machine to accomplish these tasks.

## 2.) State what the advantages of containers are
Containers are great for seperating processes from other things in an operating system. This has several advantages such as in the situation where there is an issue with one particular container, all the other containers will not be affected as long as it is run from inside that container, not on the host. They are much less wasteful than objects such as Virtual Machines so they are both faster and take up less space. This is because they do not require an entire operating system to run. They can help to eliminate dependencies and conflicts. The system is able to have many different containers that all do very differnt things all while on the same machine.

## 3.) State when you might select physical machines over virtual machines.
Virtual machines have several disadvantages that make physical machines a better choice for many different applications. The main reason is a virtual machine will always be much slower than a physical machine because it is an operating system running on top of the host computer. This means it will take longer for requests to be processed. A virtual machine is also only as fast as the device it is running on and often times it is hard to make it run faster. It can be harder for hackers to gain access into a physical machine than a virtual machine so the owner has less of a chance of being attacked.

## 4.) Write a few paragraphs on how cloud would aid microservices.
One of the first major companies to intertwine the cloud and microservices successfully and deploy them with great success was Netflix. Microservices and the cloud were basically meant to work together even without specifically being built for it. Cloud applications are loosely coupled and highly cohesive in a similar sense to how micro services do the same thing. Using microservices along with the cloud, they help development teams leverage flexibility and scalability. They prove to be resilient when there is a failure and ensure that the vast majority of the application will continue to run to prevent major catastrophies. 

Using the cloud can help save companies a lot of money on the architecture they would need to have in their data centers in order to support the traffic that goes through their sites. The companies that have embraced microservices and used them along with the cloud are also able to create applications will better agility that allows them to manage them and their infrastructure better. It will also help them be able to develop and release updates in a much more timely manor. This is due to the fact that when the development team is working on an update, there is much less of a chance of issues arrising in other areas of the application.

It is critcal that modern applications that customers are looking for. They need to be fast and be functioning at all times. If there is a failure of one of the systems of the application it should only affect that part of the application and no others. Speed is critcal and that is where combining the microservice with the cloud helps. It is also important to do this at the lowest cost possible and not having to always buy and upgrade hardware helps to keep costs as low as possible maximizing profits and keeping prices down for the customer.
